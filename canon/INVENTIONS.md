# Invention Log

Everything built without reference backing, recorded permanently so that "what the show
established" and "what we extrapolated" never blur together.

Each entry states what was invented, why it was necessary, what constrained the choice, and
what evidence would overturn it.

## INV-001 — Section proportions rescaled from a contradicted source

**Invented:** All section dimensions in `00-MASTER.md` §1.1 — Blue/Red/Green section diameters
and lengths, bio-habitat interior dimensions.

**Why necessary:** Only one source (`other map 4.jpg`) gives a complete dimensional breakdown,
and its overall length contradicts show canon by 2.589×.

**Constrained by:** Miller's proportions are internally consistent and cross-check correctly
(π × D × L reproduces his stated surface area). Rescaling preserves every ratio and changes
only the absolute scale, which show canon fixes independently at 8,047 m.

**Overturned by:** any production drawing with dimensions, or a frame allowing a section to be
measured against a known-size object (a Starfury, a docking bay, a human figure).

## INV-002 — Rotation rate of 1.79 rpm

**Invented:** Station rotation period of 33.5 s (ω = 0.18775 rad/s).

**Why necessary:** No rotation rate is stated on screen, but spin gravity cannot be simulated
without one, and it determines Coriolis magnitude everywhere.

**Constrained by:** The show depicts normal human gait and unremarkable gravity in habitation
sections → 1.0 g at the habitat floor. With r = 278.3 m fixed by INV-001, the rate follows
exactly. The result (1.79 rpm) lands comfortably below the ~2–3 rpm human tolerance threshold,
which is a meaningful independent sanity check rather than a coincidence.

**Overturned by:** dialogue or a display stating a rotation rate or gravity value; or a shot
of the drum interior long enough to time the rotation against a fixed feature.

## INV-003 — Adoption of the longitudinal sector model

**Invented:** Treating sectors as longitudinal ranges rather than nested radial layers.

**Why necessary:** Hull geometry must be built before interiors, and only the longitudinal
model constrains hull geometry. See `CONFLICTS.md` §C-003.

**Constrained by:** `other map 2.jpg` ties each sector name to a visible hull position.

**Overturned by:** resolution of C-003. **NOW OVERTURNED — see CONFLICTS.md C-003 UPDATE.**

Completing the longitudinal framework showed that only 50% of the station is pressurised, that
the habitable volume is four separated regions, and that the Green section alone accounts for
73% of it. Six sectors cannot be laid out as longitudinal slices across that, because Grey and
Brown would land on unpressurised truss spine. The longitudinal model is retained only as
exterior labelling; interiors must use a nested model.

This invention did its job: it was adopted provisionally to unblock hull geometry, it was
logged rather than assumed, and the geometry it produced is what disproved it.
