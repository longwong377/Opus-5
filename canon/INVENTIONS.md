# Invention Log

Everything built without reference backing, recorded permanently so that "what the show
established" and "what we extrapolated" never blur together.

Each entry states what was invented, why it was necessary, what constrained the choice, and
what evidence would overturn it.

## INV-001 — Section proportions rescaled from a contradicted source

**Invented:** All section dimensions in `00-MASTER.md` §1.1 — Blue/Red/Green section diameters
and lengths, bio-habitat interior dimensions.

**Why necessary:** Only one source (`other map 4.jpg`) gives a complete dimensional breakdown,
and its overall length contradicts show canon by 2.589×.

**Constrained by:** Miller's proportions are internally consistent and cross-check correctly
(π × D × L reproduces his stated surface area). Rescaling preserves every ratio and changes
only the absolute scale, which show canon fixes independently at 8,047 m.

**Overturned by:** any production drawing with dimensions, or a frame allowing a section to be
measured against a known-size object (a Starfury, a docking bay, a human figure).

## INV-002 — Rotation rate of 1.79 rpm

**Invented:** Station rotation period of 33.5 s (ω = 0.18775 rad/s).

**Why necessary:** No rotation rate is stated on screen, but spin gravity cannot be simulated
without one, and it determines Coriolis magnitude everywhere.

**Constrained by:** The show depicts normal human gait and unremarkable gravity in habitation
sections → 1.0 g at the habitat floor. With r = 278.3 m fixed by INV-001, the rate follows
exactly. The result (1.79 rpm) lands comfortably below the ~2–3 rpm human tolerance threshold,
which is a meaningful independent sanity check rather than a coincidence.

**Overturned by:** dialogue or a display stating a rotation rate or gravity value; or a shot
of the drum interior long enough to time the rotation against a fixed feature.

## INV-003 — Adoption of the longitudinal sector model

**Invented:** Treating sectors as longitudinal ranges rather than nested radial layers.

**Why necessary:** Hull geometry must be built before interiors, and only the longitudinal
model constrains hull geometry. See `CONFLICTS.md` §C-003.

**Constrained by:** `other map 2.jpg` ties each sector name to a visible hull position.

**Overturned by:** resolution of C-003. **NOW OVERTURNED — see CONFLICTS.md C-003 UPDATE.**

Completing the longitudinal framework showed that only 50% of the station is pressurised, that
the habitable volume is four separated regions, and that the Green section alone accounts for
73% of it. Six sectors cannot be laid out as longitudinal slices across that, because Grey and
Brown would land on unpressurised truss spine. The longitudinal model is retained only as
exterior labelling; interiors must use a nested model.

This invention did its job: it was adopted provisionally to unblock hull geometry, it was
logged rather than assumed, and the geometry it produced is what disproved it.

## INV-004 — Per-species name grammars

**Invented:** Generative naming patterns for Narn, Centauri, Minbari, human, Drazi, pak'ma'ra
and Vorlon residents (`station/npc/names.py`).

**Why necessary:** Canon population is 250,000 (authority 1). Hand-authoring that many names
is not possible, and a shared syllable pool would be immediately wrong — a Narn name and a
Centauri name are never mistakable for each other on screen.

**Constrained by:** Each grammar is fitted to names actually spoken on screen, and each records
its evidence in the code. Narn from G'Kar, Na'Toth, Ta'Lon, G'Quan, Na'Far, Du'Rog. Centauri
from Londo Mollari, Vir Cotto, Urza Jaddo, Carn Mollari — where Londo and Carn sharing Mollari
is what establishes that the second element is a *house*, not a surname. Minbari from Delenn,
Lennier, Neroon, Draal, Dukhat, Rathenn. Human surnames span several real-world traditions
because Earth Alliance is explicitly multinational.

**Evidence quality varies and is flagged in the code:**

- **Vorlon has two attested names** (Kosh, Ulkesh). A generator on two data points would be
  invention dressed as inference, so Vorlon is a **closed list**, not a generator, and a test
  asserts it stays one.
- **Drazi are usually addressed by title on screen**, so their pattern is inferred from
  phonetics rather than from attested names. Marked THIN EVIDENCE.
- **pak'ma'ra** rests mainly on the species name itself, which carries the pattern:
  three short elements, apostrophe-separated, lowercase.

**Overturned by:** any further attested names, particularly for Vorlon or Drazi, which would
convert inference into evidence. Adding an attested name to a grammar's `attested` tuple and
re-running the tests is the intended workflow.
