# Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-07-27 · **Session 2**

## Where we are

**The station's core hull exists and is canon-verified.** 253,184 triangles, 8,046.9 m long
against canon's 8,047, generated entirely from `station/schema/station.yaml` and gated by 17
passing canon assertions. It renders and it is recognisably Babylon 5.

What remains on the exterior is every non-axisymmetric structure — fins, solar arrays, comms
pylons, cobra bays, cargo modules, domes. Interiors stay blocked on C-003 and C-004.

## Session 1 — foundation

- **Verification loop proven.** Mesa lavapipe installed, enumerates **Vulkan 1.4 on CPU**
  (`llvmpipe`). Godot renders on Vulkan, so offscreen render → PNG → direct image inspection
  is a working aesthetic feedback loop with no GPU and no human. This was the single largest
  risk to the project and it is closed.
- **102 reference files sorted** from the dump into 13 subject/sector folders.
- **Canon codex written** — `canon/00-MASTER.md`, `CONFLICTS.md`, `INVENTIONS.md`.
- **C-001 resolved.** `other map 4.jpg` (Miller) states 3,108 m overall length; show canon says
  five miles. Show canon wins at 8,047 m; Miller's proportions rescaled by k = 2.5891.
  Had this gone unnoticed, the entire station would have been built at 39% scale.
- **C-005 found.** The Contract 5 schematic's scale bar is internally inconsistent — left group
  127.7 px/km, right group 125.7, but the 3→5 km span reads 105.5. The reproduction is spliced.
  That sheet is authoritative for topology only, never for dimensions.
- **Spin gravity derived.** 1.0 g at r = 278.3 m → ω = 0.18775 rad/s, period 33.5 s, 1.79 rpm.
  Sits below the human Coriolis tolerance threshold, which is a meaningful cross-check.
- **Project memory** — `CLAUDE.md`, ADRs 0001–0003, this file.
- **Schema v0** — `station/schema/station.yaml`: coordinate convention, global properties,
  section dimensions, exterior system manifest, sector model.
- **Tools** — `refzoom.py`, `measure_schematic.py`, `sort_references.py`.

- **OW-001 calibration established.** `other map 4.jpg` calibrated: station spans px 71→2048,
  centreline at y=388, giving **0.6361 px per Miller-metre** (1.572 Miller-m/px, 4.070 real
  m/px after k). Confirmed that Miller's Green Section outer length and Bio-Habitat interior
  length are both 1058 m and correspond to one continuous envelope — **the Green Section is
  the habitat drum**, 2,739.3 m at real scale.

- **OW-001 COMPLETE.** Longitudinal framework read segment-by-segment at 3× against a
  calibrated 50 m grid: fourteen features with z-extents from aft terminus to forward
  deflector spike. Logged C-006 (Miller's drawing vs his own table) and identified the
  explosive disconnect point at real z = 2,680 m as a structural boundary — everything aft
  of it detaches as one assembly.
- **Radius profile extracted.** 1,978 samples at 4.07 m spacing, `station/schema/radius_profile.json`.
  Hull is now fully defined as a surface of revolution. Two extraction failures found and
  fixed (inset photograph read as hull; leader lines followed instead of the outline —
  solved by a horizontal run-length filter, since leaders outnumber the hull locally and
  defeat outlier rejection). Verified by overlaying the trace back onto the drawing.
- **Independent cross-check passed.** Measured envelope vs table diameters: Red agrees to
  5.7%, Green to 3.9%. The two are derived independently, so this validates both the
  0.6361 px/m calibration and the k = 2.5891 rescale.
- **Finding:** the station's widest structure is the **aft hull block at ~957 m envelope
  diameter**, which Miller's table never names. Not the Red Section.

## Session 2 — the hull exists

- **Hull generator built.** `station/generate_hull.py` lathes the longitudinal framework and
  radius profile into a closed surface of revolution grouped by feature.
  **253,184 triangles, 8,046.9 m long** against canon's 8,047.
- **Canon assertions built.** `station/validate.py`, **17/17 passing**: gapless and
  non-overlapping features, subfeature containment, profile spans canon length, cross-check
  agreement, hull length, no unassigned or degenerate geometry, closed at both ends, triangle
  budget, max radius agreement, spin gravity exactly 1.000 g, period consistency, rpm below
  the Coriolis threshold. Runs in CI on every commit.
- **The generator caught a schema gap on first run** — 189 m and 5,888 triangles unassigned
  between green_section's table-derived end (5846) and its own habitat_cylinder subfeature
  (6035). That is C-006 surfacing as geometry. Fixed, and validate.py now blocks recurrence.
- **Software renderer built.** `tools/preview_render.py` — schema edit to inspectable image in
  ~5 seconds, no Godot and no GPU. First render is recognisably Babylon 5.
- **Ring artifacts diagnosed and fixed.** The raw profile flipped gradient sign on 20% of
  samples, which lathed into visible rings. A plain low-pass would have rounded off the real
  section transitions, so smoothing detects step edges (>4 px) and smooths only between them.
  **Sign flips 396 → 73, max radius unchanged at 480.3 m.** Verified by re-render.
- **Godot build fixed and running.** The proxy 403s GitHub archive and codeload paths;
  switched to a shallow clone.

## Known limitations of the current hull

The lathe produces the **core hull only**. A surface of revolution cannot represent the
non-axisymmetric structures, all of which remain to be added as separate components:
reactor cooling fins (12), heat exchange / solar arrays (12), communications grid pylons (2),
cobra bays (28), cargo modules (42), observation domes and rotundas, docking ports, and the
sensor and deflector arrays.

## Next session — start here

1. **Finish the Godot build** (`tools/build_godot.sh`, ~40 min on 4 cores) and publish the
   double-precision binary as a GitHub Release asset so later sessions fetch it in seconds.
2. **Non-axisymmetric components.** Add the fins, solar arrays, comms pylons, cobra bays and
   cargo modules as schema-driven instanced components placed against the longitudinal
   framework. This is what turns a lathed shape into Babylon 5.
3. **Set up CI** to run `station/validate.py` on every push.
4. **OW-002.** Derive Grey / Brown / Yellow extents as the remainder of the 8,047 m budget.

## Blocked

| Item | Blocked by | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| All interior level geometry | C-004 — level numbering unresolved | Lift display, deck plan, or dialogue tying a level number to a location placeable radially |
| Interior sector layout | C-003 — sector topology unresolved | Wayfinding signage or transit display showing sector adjacency |
| Grey / Brown / Yellow interiors | Zero reference coverage | Any material at all for these sectors |
| Starfury cockpit | Zero reference coverage | Cockpit interior stills |

## Reference gaps worth filling

Ranked by how much they unblock. Nothing here stops progress on the hull, but all of it
becomes blocking once interiors start:

1. **Deck plans or lift displays** — would resolve both blocking conflicts at once.
2. **Brown Sector / Downbelow** — zero files.
3. **Yellow Sector** — zero files.
4. **Starfury cockpit interior** — zero files; needed for Act III.
5. **Grey Sector** — one file.
